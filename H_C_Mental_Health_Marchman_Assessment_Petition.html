PLEASE NOTE:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:20px; arial font">
When filing petitions in the Marksman Act Court, it is important, as the petitioner, to understand what may be expected and to note that matters may not always be handled in the way one may want them to be handled.  This is a court, and there are certain laws and procedures that must be followed. The respondent has certain rights, and these rights will be upheld.
<br>
1. Please make sure that all the information provided is true and correct.  All the information and observations in the petition for the assessment and stabilization must be form first-hand knowledge.
<br>
2. Please understand that in the petition the petitioner has asked the court to become involved in the respondent's substance abuse issues.
<br>
3. Once the assessment has been completed, the petitioner has the opportunity to return to the courthouse to file the petition for court ordered treatment.  If treatment is ordered. the court will follow all recommendations of the assessor.  In some cases, the petitioner may not agree with all of the recommendations.
<br>
4. Both the petitioner and the respondent, if present will be provided with a plan in order to remain in compliance with the court order.  If the respondent is an adult (18 or over), the petitioner can decide what assistance he or she will provide.
<br>
5. Please be advise that the respondent will be ordered to provide at least 2 random drug screens per week.  In some cases it may be necessary to order more than 2 random drug screens per week.  The respondent will be required to follow the treatment agency's protocol in regards to drug screening.  The respondent's failure to submit to the drug screens could result in non-compliance with a court order.
<br>
6. If RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT is recommended, please be aware that there is a very long waiting list for admission into a residential program.  <b>There is nothing the court can do to decrease the wait time.</b>
<br>
7. There are no lock-down residential facilities.  If the respondent does not want to stay in treatment, he or she can walk away at any time.  However, please be advised that, if the respondent does not follow the court order, the respondent will be scheduled to return to court to face an order to show cause.  In some cases, the respondent may be sent to detention or jail.
